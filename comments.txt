downgrading
Jimenez
and
Wilson
to
Jota
and
King
I
know
KDB
is
a
great
player
but
is
he
as
nailed
on
as
Sterling
with
both
starting
and
points
this
season
Damn

I
ve
just
made
some
cuts
of
Ake
and
Duffy
to
Dunk
and
O
Connel
to
facilitate
an
upgrade
to
Siggy


&amp
x200B


Points
of
concern
for
me
are
Townsend
6m
bracket
for
midfielders
seems
really
weak
this
year
considering
knocking
him
down
to
a
5
5m
so
i
can
upgrade
VVD
to
TAA

&amp
x200B


Also
unsure
on
KDB
as
a
premium
pick
I
think
he
s
getting
slightly
overlooked
and
has
good
differential
potential
but
I
m
aware
downgrading
him
to
Bilva
would
free
up
funds
for
an
upgrade
of
King

better

I
personally
think
KDB
will
be
an
assist
machine
if
he
remains
fit
for
the
majority
of
the
season


Also
I
did
not
double
up
on

defence
as
most
of
you
did
Instead
I
went
for
a
relatively
balanced
out

which
can
deliver
consistent
goals


Please

Right

for

their

at

is
a
difficulty
3
but
if

perform

like
away
leading

do
they
change
the

ranking
to
