Kante vs Jorginho

Also, any suggestion for a midfielder upto 6.5 mil  instead of them would be helpful.
would it be a wise strategy to not go for the glamorous and expected choices of alisson/ederson/lloris and go for a 4.5 keeper like pope as a starter

and then dump the leftover points into the outfield players?
Thoughts on these options:

(1) Brooks + 4.5 DEF rotation (4-4-2)

(2) 4.5 MID + VVD + 4.5 DEF (5-3-2) - would either be forced to play 4.5 DEF or rotate with 4.5 MID for basically 2 points each week

(3) 4.5 MID + Gomez/Matip + 5.5 DEF (5-3-2)

Team (0.0 ITB)

Ryan (Button)

Robertson/Walker/Digne/Taylor (Fredericks)

Salah/Sterling/Sigurdsson/Brooks (Dendoncker)

Vardy/King (Wickham)
is kante worth it as a 5.0 mid?

i know he doesn't score as much and chelsea will be a wildcard because of lamps but 5.0 seems too good to pass up
[RMT Please](https://i.imgur.com/Zm4dwsa.jpg) 

Not sure if it’s worth dropping Pereira to a 5.5 like Trippier or Chilwell to have an extra .5 to put towards strengthening a bench player. I’m leaning towards it not being worth it for the few extra points I may get from a 5.0 mid or forward.
Potentially drop Pereira to a 4.5, maybe take a punt on El Mohamody and upgrade Ryan to Ederson?
RMT please, first draft. TIA

Ederson (McGovern4.0)

Play primarily 442 rotating Tark and Dunk. May swap Jota/King for Deulofeu based on form.

Got Pickford in nets because of relatively easy early fixtures. Thinking of maybe downgrading Zaha to Perez and upgrading Pickford to ederson. Also don’t know who is the 4.5 mid most likely to get minutes? Just trying to think of where to invest that extra million

AM I CRAZY FOR TRYING A 5-4-1 and if not, how can i improve this?
Sterling + 6.5 FWD 

or

KdB + Vardy
How is this going do you think? Focussing on 2 premiums in mid and premium defenders.

Been doing a little experimenting and have come up with something interesting -

GK: Heaton/Button

DEF: Lascalles/Cathcart/Dunk/Diop/Kelly

MID: Salah/Sterling/Richarlison/Dendoncker/Hayden

FWD: Wilson/Aubameyang/Vardy

Veered hard away from the template here
Is there a reason we're sleeping on Walker?


Ederson (Woodman)

Azpi, Walker, Van Dijk, Robbo, Digne

Salah, Sterling, Fraser (Stephens, Dendoncker)

King, Deulefeu (Nketiah)
Aguero + 7m Midfielder

or

Vardy + De Bruyne

Sterling, Moura, Siggy, Tielemans, (Dendonker/4.5)

Kane, King, (Wickham/4.5)

&amp;#x200B;

Should I downgrade my Keeper to a 4.5 and spread that extra cash to make Kelly a 4.5 DEF and upgrade Wickham to Andone?
Thoughts on my team pls:

Ryan Button

Robertson Digne Zinchenko Diop Kelly

Salah KDB Sigurdsson Zaha Dendoncker

Vardy Jiminez King
Thoughts? 5-4-1 to start out, love having some promoted players in there every year too so yeah

Pope

Robbo VVD Laporte O'Connell Digne

Salah Buendia Sigurdsson Sterling

Vardy

4.0 , 4.5 , 4.5, and 4.5 on the bench



---


The key for me is Leicester midfield, would try and bring I  Ayoze or Maddison and switch up my striking options after a couple of weeks

Don't know which 6.0 MF to go for

- Buendia

- Barnes

- Greilash

- Trossard/Jahanbakhsh for more of a punt 

- Gudmundsson/McNeill

- JWP

Also keeping an eye on United and Chelsea players, could be some fucking bargains in there if both get their shit together (Pogba, Rashford, AWB/Lindelöf, Mount, Abraham/Giroud/Batshuayi, Barkley, CHO, the list goes on and on)
Which lineup of 5 players would you rather in your starting lineup 

A) Salah, Siggurdsson, Fraser, Zaha, Deulofeu    
B) Sterling, Salah, Brooks, Perez, Dendonker   
C) Sterling, KDB, Brooks, Perez, TAA
Ryan, (Button)

Trent, Robbo, Laporte, Walker, Digne

Salah, Siggy, (Stephens, Hayden, Dendoncker)

Kane, Jiménez, King



Possible adjustments: 

Swap Salah out for Sterling and replace Walker with Van Dijk.

Swap out Kane for Greenwood and upgrade a mid to Sterling.

(I feel like this team really has zero questionable picks which i love. All these players i really trust to do well.

Azpilicueta - Digne - Van Dijk (Cathcart, Kelly)

What do you guys think of having

Debruyne/6mil forward( dcl or ings most likely).
      
Or
Vardy/ 6.5 midfield ( Perez or Brooks)
Pick one: Team 1 gives me a better defence but i lose Sterling as a captaincy option

Tempted to switch Lucas for sigursson but as Son is out his fixture against Aston Villa seems too good to miss


Also I’m torn between Jota and Deulofeu, as I’m starting Ryan I don’t particularly want to Start Deulofeu in GW1 as they play each other but might do it to save myself a transfer
RMT please. Not a great bench at all, but maybe that’s okay in the first few weeks pre-WC?

What's the case with Benjamin Mendy now? He was everyone's hero less than a year ago.

Pope (Stekelenburg)

Salah / Sterling / Siggy / Brooks  (Dendoncker)

Vardy  (Wickham, Xande)


Tinkered to get a lineup with Salah, Sterling, and Vardy while holding into Siggy,  Digne &amp; Pool/City defenders and came up with this. Figured I could go 4-5-1 if Cathcart or whoever my 4.5 def after GW4 has a bad fixture. Thoughts? Could use advice on whether this team has enough transfer flexibility since I'm not quite sure how to play transfers.
Pope, 4.0

Digne, VVD, Robertson, Dunk, 4.0

Fraser, Richarlison, Perez, Salah, 4.5

Kane, Vardy, 4.0

&amp;#x200B;

Ederson/(4.0)

TAA-VVD-Digne-Ake (Dunk)

Salah-Siggy-Zaha-Brooks (Dendondecker)

Kane-King (Andone)

&amp;#x200B;

Initial plan is to use Zaha for the first 2 GWs and then reevaluate. Keep an eye on LEI and see where Perez is playing and how Maddison is getting on. See how CHE and MUN line up as I think there could be bargains with both teams. Thoughts?

How would you rate the following:
1. KDB + Vardy
2. Sterling + Jota
3. Fraser + Kane

And: Jota or King or Brooks or Perez?

Thanks!
Sorry for the stupid question, but what do the numbers on flairs mean?
Keane or Coleman from EVE?

Ryan (Button)

Robertson - VVD - Digne (Cathcart, Kelly)

Can't decide between these two:

A) Kane, KDB, Coleman

B) Deulofeu, Sterling, Robertson + 0.5 ITB
Would I be out of my mind to only go for 1 LIV def? My current setup only has VVD
Salah/Bilva or
Mane/KDB?
Ryan (Button)

Wan Bissaka - Alderwield - Van Djik - Digne (Diop)

Salah - Neves - Fraser - Sterling (Torreira)

Wilson - Deulofeu (Andone)

Any thoughts? It's my first time doing this.
Also I have 1.5M in the bank, I've heard different opinions about money ITB. Some say it's for flexibility. Others say you have to use for "max potential.
Ryan (Button)

VVD TAA Digne Laporte (4m)

Salah Sterling Siggy Maddison (Dendoncker)

King Jota (4.5m)

Considering going 3-5-2 and upgrading Dendoncker to Zaha or Brooks. Also not 100% on Maddison but the set pieces are swaying me.
My Sterling-less team at the moment: (1.0 ITB)

Ryan  
TAA VVD Laporte Digne  
Salah(C) Siggy Fraser Maddison  
Vardy Jimenez

I don't like being without Sterling, but I have to butcher my team to fit him in. Worth it?

Why does the 5 at the back look so sexy.. Ugh now to fit Salah in somehow
Top 10 players not on my team IMO:

1. Mane
2. Sterling
3. Aubameybang
4. Aguero
5. Alisson
6. Ederson
7. Jimenez
8. Vardy

Despite the fact that King is on pens and is 1.5 cheaper, Wilson's statistics are 2x superior and similar to Kane. Any suggestions are welcome!!!! :)
Is there any reason Coleman is a popular choice?

Too risky to start with gomez?
Robbo, TAA and Deulofeu vs. VVD, Taylor/Fredericks rotating and Vardy?

Second option means no double Liverpool defence.
