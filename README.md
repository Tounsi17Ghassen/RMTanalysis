# RMTanalysis
this algorithm helps creating a word cloud from comments on a reddit thread

how does this work ?
first you go to the RMT thread and load its json file (just add .json at the end of its link)
save it as entry.json
run scratch.py
go to https://www.wordclouds.com/
copy the content of c1.txt into word list
generate

you may find words that are not names of players, you can remove them OR add them into stops.txt and run scratch.py again, this will prevent these words from appearing in the future
